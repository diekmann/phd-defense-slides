  Abstract                 = {Most texts describing data structures give imperative implementations. These are either difficult or tedious to convert to a functional (non side-effecting) form. This technical report describes the implementation of sets in the functional subset of Standard ML. The implementation is based on balanced binary trees. Tree balacing algorithms are usually complex. We show that this need not be the case---the trick is to abstract away from the rebalancing scheme to achieve a simple and efficient implementation. A complete implementation of sets is given, including the operations union, difference and intersection. Finally, program transformation techniques are used to derive a more efficient union operation.},

  Abstract                 = {Firewalls are an important means to secure critical ICT infrastructures. As configurable off-the-shelf prod\-ucts, the effectiveness of a firewall crucially depends on both the correctness of the implementation itself as well as the correct configuration. While testing the implementation can be done once by the manufacturer, the configuration needs to be tested for each application individually. This is particularly challenging as the configuration, implementing a firewall policy, is inherently complex, hard to understand, administrated by different stakeholders and thus difficult to validate. This paper presents a formal model of both stateless and stateful firewalls (packet filters), including NAT, to which a specification-based conformance test case gen\-eration approach is applied. Furthermore, a verified optimisation technique for this approach is presented: starting from a formal model for stateless firewalls, a collection of semantics-preserving policy transformation rules and an algorithm that optimizes the specification with respect of the number of test cases required for path coverage of the model are derived. We extend an existing approach that integrates verification and testing, that is, tests and proofs to support conformance testing of network policies. The presented approach is supported by a test framework that allows to test actual firewalls using the test cases generated on the basis of the formal model. Finally, a report on several larger case studies is presented. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a role model to cope with the complexity of network configuration. Roles associate policy requirements as well as configuration templates with nodes in the network. One goal is to remove redundancy in configuration data to avoid inconsistent changes and diverging setup of similar devices. The other goal is to ensure that network policies are respected by the configuration. This role model is embedded into the project Verified Network Configuration (Verinec). Together with the Verinec XML network model, roles provide a powerful instrument to configure large networks.},

In these systems, policies are usually used to simplify the tasks of the system management, thus making way for further system enlargement. Accordingly, a variety of policy languages are proposed to express intentions of administrators in the policy-driven systems, especially for the network and security management. This paper, therefore, investigates current works, discusses the key issues, and then outlines the future work of policy languages. },

  Abstract                 = {<p>The fastest tools for network reachability queries use ad-hoc algorithms to compute all packets from a source S that can reach a destination D. This paper examines whether network reachability can be solved efficiently using existing verification tools. While most verification tools only compute reachability (“Can S reach D?”), we efficiently generalize them to compute all reachable packets. Using new and old benchmarks, we compare model checkers, SAT solvers and various Datalog implementations. The only existing verification method that worked competitively on all benchmarks in seconds was Datalog with a new composite Filter-Project operator and a Difference of Cubes representation. While Datalog is slightly slower than the Hassel C tool, it is far more flexible. We also present new results that more precisely characterize the computational complexity of network verification. This paper also provides a gentle introduction to program verification for the networking community.</p> <p>We would like to thank Jim Larus for inspiring this work.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {With the Internet of Things, more and more devices become remotely manageable. The amount and heterogeneity of managed devices make the task of implementing management functionality challenging. Future Pervasive Computing scenarios require implementing a plethora of services to provide management functionality. With growing demand on services, reducing the emerging complexity becomes increasingly important. A simple-to-use programming model for implementing complex management scenarios is essential to enable developers to create the growing amount of required management software at high quality. The paper presents how data-centric mechanisms, as known from network management, can be utilized to create a service-oriented architecture (SOA) for management services. The resulting shift of complexity from access functionality towards data structures introduces new flexibility and facilitates the programming of management applications significantly. This is evaluated with a user study on the reference implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {Ensuring correct network behavior is hard. This is the case even for simple networks, and adding middleboxes only complicates this task. In this paper, we demonstrate a fundamental property of networks. Namely, we show a way of using a network to emulate the Rule 110 cellular automaton. We do so using just a set of network devices with simple features such as packet matching, header rewriting and round-robin loadbalancing. Therefore, we show that a network can emulate any Turing machine. This ultimately means that analyzing dynamic network behavior can be as hard as analyzing an arbitrary program. Analyzing a network containing middleboxes is already understood to be hard. Our result shows that using even only statically configured switches can make the problem intractable.},

Analysis of real configuration data show that corporate firewalls are often enforcing rule sets that violate well established security guidelines. Firewalls are the cornerstone of corporate intranet security. Once a company acquires a firewall, a systems administrator must configure and manage it according to a security policy that meets the company's needs. Configuration is a crucial task, probably the most important factor in the security a firewall provides.},

  Abstract                 = {linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind LXC, LXD, LXCFS and CGManager. The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment for the development of Linux container technologies. Our main focus is system containers. That is, containers which offer an environment as close to possible as the one you'd get from a VM but without the overhead that comes with running a separate kernel and simulating all the hardware. This is achieved through a combination of kernel security features such as namespaces, mandatory access control and control groups.},
